# box.animate

Demo: https://codepen.io/c_vilander/full/dPMRpr

## Project Status
 - Done 
 
## Intro
As a part of the Web Animations spec, Chrome 39 has added a set of playback control features which, for example, makes it possible to pause(), and reverse() web animations. Interesting of course, and since I’ve written a post where I played around with the element.animate() function I had to give this a try as well.

Basically what I’ve done is an animation that you can play and reverse. Make sure that you are using Chrome 39+ when you view the demo.
